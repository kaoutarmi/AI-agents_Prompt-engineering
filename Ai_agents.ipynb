En hébergeant le modèle localement, Ollama permet de traiter les requêtes avec une faible latence, de garantir la confidentialité des données et de travailler hors ligne. L'installation typique consiste à exécuter le serveur Ollama sur votre machine locale et à interagir avec lui via une API, par exemple en envoyant des requêtes HTTP au serveur local à http://localhost:<port>/api/generate. Cette approche est idéale pour les environnements où le contrôle des ressources de calcul et la sécurité des données sont prioritaires.\n",
